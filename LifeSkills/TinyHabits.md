# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits Reflection

---

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg 
### Question 1 - **Most interesting story or idea:**  
BJ Fogg’s story about teaching his friend to floss just one tooth really hit me — starting tiny makes it hard to say no. What stood out most was his point that emotions, not repetition, build habits. It’s less about willpower and more about designing success into the routine.

### Question 2 - **Using B = MAP to build habits:**  
- **B = Behavior** happens when  
- **M = Motivation**,  
- **A = Ability**, and  
- **P = Prompt** converge.  
To make habits easier:
- Reduce effort (increase Ability)  
- Attach the habit to an existing routine (create a Prompt)  
- Don’t rely on high Motivation—design for low-effort success

### Question 3  - **Why celebrate ("Shine") after a habit?**  
Celebrating locks the habit in by giving your brain a quick hit of positivity. Even something small like a fist pump or saying “yes!” makes you want to do it again. For me, that kind of boost can keep branding work or coding breakthroughs feeling exciting and consistent.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day 
### Question 4 - **Most interesting story or idea:**  
The idea that getting just 1% better every day adds up fast was super motivating. The British cycling team proved it by stacking small wins in sleep, nutrition, and training until they dominated the Olympics. It reminds me that even small design edits, code cleanups, or video tweaks are quietly building something big.

### Question 5  - **Perspective on Identity:**  
Habits slowly shape who you are. It’s not “I want to run,” it’s “I’m a runner.” Each flyer I design or module I code is like casting a vote for the identity I’m building — a strong brand creator and a resilient developer.


### Question 6 - **Making a habit easier to do:**  
- Reduce friction  
- Use the 2-minute rule: make the habit so small it takes less than 2 minutes  
- Prepare your environment (e.g., keep design assets organized or have your IDE ready)  
This aligns with modular coding and visual workflows—make the first step effortless.

### Question 7 - **Making a habit harder to do:**  
- Increase friction  
- Remove cues  
- Make the action inconvenient  
For example, to reduce phone distractions, log out of social media or keep your phone in another room while coding.

## 5. Reflection

### Question 8 - **Habit to do more of:**  
Posting consistently on Arrow Coliving PG’s Instagram.

**Steps to improve it:**  
- **Cue:** Link posting to morning coffee

- **Easy:** Keep captions ready in a notes app  
- **Satisfying:** Celebrate each post with a quick review of engagement metrics or a “done” checkmark

### Question 9 - **Habit to eliminate:**  
Checking social media too frequently during work hours.

**Steps to reduce it:**  
- **Cue invisible:** Turn off notifications  
- **Unattractive:** Set a rule to check only after completing a task  
- **Hard:** Log out or move the app to a hidden folder  
- **Unsatisfying:** Track wasted time and reflect weekly to reinforce the cost
